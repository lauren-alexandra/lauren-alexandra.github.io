Hello! I am a data scientist based in Northern California with an interest in improving understanding of Earth system processes and stewarding ecosystems. My research focus is climate-informed modeling for ecosystem management with a particular emphasis on applied solutions in mitigating the impacts of hydroclimate variability. 

I enjoy exploring local ecosystems and serve as a water quality monitor for the American River Conservancy, collecting hydrological data in the Cosumnes River Watershed by recording field measurements, documenting habitat conditions, and observing species in the western Sierra river.
