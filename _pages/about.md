  Hello! I am a data scientist based in Northern California with an interest in improving understanding of Earth system processes and stewarding ecosystems. My research focus is climate-informed modeling for ecosystem management with a particular emphasis on mitigating the impacts of hydroclimate variability.

  I enjoy exploring local ecosystems and have collected hydrological data for watershed research in the Cosumnes River by recording field measurements, documenting habitat conditions, and observing species in the western Sierra river.
